# 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview
This repository captures my machine learning learning journey through a structured series of notebooks and exercises. It follows the spirit of the #100DaysOfML challenge — exploring core ML concepts, data handling techniques, and practical implementations in Python. 

## Topics Covered
The challenge includes hands-on exploration of key machine learning areas such as:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Model implementation from scratch and using libraries
- Regression, classification, clustering algorithms
- Pipeline creation and transformations
- Metrics, validation techniques, and encoding strategies
- Ensemble methods and dimensionality reduction
- Practical examples using real-world datasets

> This structure aligns with common frameworks for progressive ML learning used in community challenges. 

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – Primary language for data manipulation and model building  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive notebooks for walkthroughs and implementation  
- **Pandas / NumPy / scikit-learn** – Core libraries used throughout the exercises  

## Repository Structure
- `01. Toy Project.ipynb` – Introduction to basics and environment setup  
- `02. WorkingWithSQL.ipynb` – SQL integration practice  
- `03. UsingAPIandJSON.ipynb` – API data extraction and JSON handling  
- `04. WebScrapping.ipynb` – Data collection through scraping  
- `05–…` – Various notebooks covering preprocessing, feature handling, algorithms, and demos

Explicitly organizing notebooks by topic helps reinforce learning in a repeatable way.

## Learning Outcomes
By working through these notebooks and exercises, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Data pipelines and preprocessing workflows
- Machine learning algorithm theory and practical implementation
- Model evaluation and comparison methods
- Real-world dataset handling and exploratory techniques
