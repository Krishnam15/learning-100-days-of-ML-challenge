# 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview
This repository captures my machine learning learning journey through a structured series of notebooks and exercises. It follows the spirit of the #100DaysOfML challenge by CampusX — exploring core ML concepts, data handling techniques, and practical implementations in Python. 

## Topics Covered
The challenge includes hands-on exploration of key machine learning areas such as:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Model implementation from scratch and using libraries
- Regression, classification, clustering algorithms
- Pipeline creation and transformations
- Metrics, validation techniques, and encoding strategies
- Ensemble methods and dimensionality reduction
- Practical examples using real-world datasets

> This structure aligns with common frameworks for progressive ML learning used in community challenges.

## Repository Structure
- Topic-wise Jupyter notebooks
- Each notebook focuses on a specific concept or algorithm
- Practical examples using real-world and toy datasets

Explicitly organizing notebooks by topic helps reinforce learning in a repeatable way.

## Learning Outcomes
By working through these notebooks and exercises, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Data pipelines and preprocessing workflows
- Machine learning algorithm theory and practical implementation
- Model evaluation and comparison methods
- Real-world dataset handling and exploratory techniques

## Credits
This repository is based on the **100 Days of Machine Learning** playlist by **CampusX** on YouTube.  
The content and structure were followed for learning purposes, with all implementations written and practiced independently.
